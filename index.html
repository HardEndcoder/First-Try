                The tiger is the largest cat species who once ranged widely across Asia. Over the past 100 years, they
                have
                lost over 90% of their historic range. The global population in the wild is estimated to number between
                3,062 and 3,948 individuals, down from around 100,000 at the start of the 20th century.

            <h3>We are against hunting down poor animals</h3>
            <p>
                According to me, animals shouldn't be hunted and used for selfish needs of man. Hunting of animals
                should be banned as it creates an imbalance in environment. Example: Extinction in the tiger species.
                Animals have done nothing to deserve this but still they get killed for no reason. While animals are
                been hunted they also feel pain, as humans have a nervous system which allows them to feel pain. In
                today's day, man has being self centered and greedy. The day is not far when man will realize the
                ill-effects of hunting animals. Animals are been hunted for thrill but why don't he understand that a
                balance in the environment should be maintained for his benefit. Man is the creator of crisis, happening
                recently in the environment. So I feel that hunting is dangerous for the Environment.

                    Before late September 2017, how often did you think about lynxes, really? About their comically
                    large
                    paws (#nophotoshop), their tufty little ears, their fun-sized family packs? When was the last time
                    you
                    Googled “lynx family” just to get your medium-to-large wild cat fix? Not that recently, we bet.

                    We think all animals are at least 10-out-of-10 good. But this year, some of them have been so good
                    that
                    they, and their accomplishments, deserve special recognition. Here are some stand-out achievements
                    this
                    year, from the animals that went the extra mile. It's too hard to say which achievement is the
                    best—how
                    can a runaway emu compete with an underwater metropolis?—so these are in a random order. This year
